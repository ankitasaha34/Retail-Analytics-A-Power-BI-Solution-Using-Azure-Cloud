# Retail Analytics: A Power BI Solution Using Azure Cloud

This repository showcases an advanced retail analytics solution built using Microsoft Azure and Power BI. This project is a collaborative effort by Ankita Saha, Bhumika, Lakshya Mutneja, and Tanushree Poojary.

## Project Overview  

**Objective:**  
The project aims to address key challenges faced by mid-sized retail businesses, such as customer retention, product performance tracking, and operational inefficiencies. The solution integrates data ingestion, transformation, and visualization to provide actionable insights.  

**Key Features:**  
- **Customer Behavior Insights:** Segmentation based on purchase patterns and lifecycle progression.  
- **Product and Sales Performance:** Identification of top-performing products, aisles, and departments.  
- **Operational Optimization:** Analysis of peak order and reorder days to streamline resources.  
- **Interactive Dashboards:** Visualizations created with Power BI, enabling real-time exploration of trends and insights.  

## Problem Statement  

Retail businesses often collect vast amounts of data on customer behavior, product relationships, and operational patterns but struggle to derive actionable insights. This project tackles the following challenges:  
- Low customer retention due to lack of targeted loyalty strategies.  
- Limited visibility into product performance and reorder trends.  
- Operational inefficiencies in resource and inventory management during peak periods.  

The dataset, sourced from the [Instacart Market Basket Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/psparks/instacart-market-basket-analysis) on Kaggle, was transformed using Azure SQL and modeled into a star schema for efficient querying and visualization.  

## Technologies Used  

- **Cloud Platform:** Microsoft Azure (Blob Storage, Data Factory, SQL Database)  
- **Data Modeling:** Star Schema with fact and dimension tables  
- **Business Intelligence Tool:** Power BI for interactive dashboards and insights
